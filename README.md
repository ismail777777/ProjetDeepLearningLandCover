# ProjetDeepLearningLandCover
This is the work of HALILOUA Othmane and El Alout Ismail.
Building a deep learning model to classify images according to ten classes.
We conducted two different training processes, one using k-fold cross validation, and one that selects the model with the maximum accuracy at each epoch, and takes it as starting point for the model in the next epoch.
You find in this repository the code that we implemented, the models resulting from each training, and the submission.
PS:
best_model_fold_0.pth : for k-fold cross-validation.
best_model_max_acc_training.pth : for max accuracy training.
Haliloua_et_El_Alout_12_28_23.npy : the submission.
